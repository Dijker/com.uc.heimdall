# Heimdall - Let Homey watch over your home

This app enables you to use your Homey as a surveillance system.
All detected motion and open/closed doors and windows on selected sensors will be seen by Heimdall. All these events will be logged and when Heimdall is in a Surveillance Mode the alarm will be triggered.

## How do I get it to work?
* Add a Surveillance Mode button.
* Select the devices to monitor on the devices page. 
* Add flows to activate and deactivate the desired Surveillance Mode.
* Add a flow with the desired actions when the alarm is triggered.
* Add a flow to deactivate the alarm.
* Add an Alarm Off Button.
* Detailed instructions can be found on the Instructions tab in the apps settings.

## Version 2.0.0
* Initial rewrite to Homey V2 firmware.

## Changelog for Heimdall version 1
* The archived changelog for Heimdal Version 1 can be found in CHANGELOG V1.md 

Please remember, Heimdall is not intended to be a full blown security system.
