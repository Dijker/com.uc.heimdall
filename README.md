# Heimdall

This app makes it a bit easier to use your homey as a surveillance system.
All detected motion and open/closed doors and windows on selected sensors will be seen by Heimdall. All these events will be logged and when Heimdall is in Surveillance Mode he will trigger the alarm.

## How do I get it to work?
* Add [H] to the name of your motion and door/window sensors you want Heimdall to monitor.
* Add flows to activate and deactivate the Surveillance Mode.
* Add a flow with the desired actions when the alarm is triggered.
* Add a flow to deactivate the alarm.

## Planned features
* Settings page to select the motion and door/windows sensors to listen to.
* Button to activate/deactivate surveillance mode.
* Button to deactivate alarm.
* 

## Version 0.0.1
* Initial release.

Please remember, Heimdall is not intended to be a full blown security system.
