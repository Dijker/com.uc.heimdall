# Heimdall

This app makes it a bit easier to use Your homey as a surveillance system.
All detected motion and open/closed doors and windows on selected sensors will be seen by Heimdall. All these events will be logged and when Heimdall is in Surveillance Mode the alarm will be triggered.

## How do I get it to work?
* Add [H] to the motion and door/window sensors you want Heimdall to monitor.
* Add flows to activate and deactivate the Surveillance Mode.
* Add a flow with the desired actions when the alarm is triggered.
* Add a flow to deactivate the alarm.
* *NEW* Add a Surveillance Mode Switch to use in the Homey app.
